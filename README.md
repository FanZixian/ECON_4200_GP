# FFR projection based on the factors of FFR and Treasury Yields with HMM

## Abstract
As we all know, in the last two years the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times (increasing the Federal Funds Rate), which has had a significant impact on financial markets around the world. The rate hikes have not only brought about the strength of the US dollar, which affects the Currency Markets, but also the pricing of global assets and the anchoring of sovereigns' credits, which makes the projection of the FFR very important. However, there are a number of obstacles to FFR forecasting: 1) lagging and insufficient publicly available data due to the low frequency of macro data releases; and 2) the susceptibility of market participants to historical data bias (e.g., being overly optimistic about FFR reductions). This study hopes to combine the Taylor Rule, commonly used by the FOMC, with the treasury yields to make a more forward-looking judgement on FFR.
